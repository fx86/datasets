Contains the following datasets:
1. `demographics_w_iso3_codes.csv`: contains a mapping of the countries with their major ethnicities and spoken languages. Country list was obtained from UN-FAO ([URL]( https://data.apps.fao.org/catalog/dataset/b9b7e6a6-7466-4f17-b064-469691346583/resource/f1b4b92d-8abd-43be-bea3-c0dc7f82ccf9/download/iso3.csv)).
ChatGPT was used to map the ethnicity and language mapping. Details of some major countries were manually verified; the verification of the rest is left to the end-user.
